    "The attributes (columns) of the dataset are the PID (Project ID), Category (numbers indicating what topic the project falls under), Subcategory (numbers indicating the subtopics within each category), the Project Location Name, State, County, and Country. Other relevant attributes included are the Project Currency, the Project’s Original Goal (how much money the creators were aiming for), amount of money pledged, the number of backers, the launched date, deadline date, and state. State is defined as either suspended (funding for a project is stopped when the project violates Kickstarter’s rules), canceled (the creators of a project dropped the project themselves), failed (the project didn’t meet funding goals), and successful (project meets funding goals). Each observation (row) corresponds to one unique project, indexed with a CaseID.\n",

    "This dataset was created by Jonathan Leland, Kickstarter’s Head of Insights for a cross-sectional study on the different creative projects that seek crowdfunding. He created the dataset to observe data on the projects from Kickstarter. The creation of this dataset is funded by Kickstarter Data, the company crowdfunding platform that directs the Kickstarter Project. The study is distributed through the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). \n",

    "Some columns may be presented as optional for users to fill out, so we’re left with missing values in the data. For example, for the PROJECT_LOCATION_STATE, PROJECT_LOCATION_COUNTY, PROJECT_LOCATION_COUNTRY column, there are some missing data values. But there are no missing values in the PROJECT_LOCATION_NAME, meaning that the project creators were required to put down the location name for their project. Several restrictions were placed on the data before releasing it for public use. The names of the people/groups who created past Kickstarter projects (NAME) and the links to their projects’ websites (URL_NAME), and the descriptions of their projects (BLURB) are masked in the public data set. This ensures anonymity of survey participants and prevents disclosure risk from survey participants.\n",
