    "The Kickstarter Dataset we found is based on the crowdfunding website, Kickstarter, which has helped fund many startups, products, and projects to become a reality. It is a combination of the publicly available information on past successful and unsuccessful kickstarter projects and data about the backers of each project. In this project, we are interested in exploring, what are the predictors for the success or failure of a Kickstarter campaign? How do kickstarter campaign success rates compare for US vs Non-US based projects? \n",

These variables include NAME, URL_NAME, and PROJECT_PAGE_LOCATION_COUNTRY.  In addition, there were some rows that had missing values, particularly in the PROJECT_PAGE_LOCATION_STATE, and PROJECT_PAGE_LOCATION_COUNTY columns which may indicate that these are user-inputs that are optional. In addition, although documentation for each dataset was provided upon download, descriptions for qualitative variables like STATE were unclear in how they categorized each startup into the 4 possible states (successful, failed, suspended, canceled). \n",

    "After opening a portion of the original backer_location tsv file, we observed that there were many rows that had missing values in either/both the USER_LOCATION_STATE and the USER_LOCATION_COUNTRY column. In addition, Numbers, the application tried to open the raw data in, warned us that it can only show the first 999999 rows of data. We either have to separate the original tsv into multiple tsv files to look at all of the data or do a boolean statement or GROUPBY to extract the most relevant information (Note: the first 182,253 entries have 50 people backing the project or more). Due to these issues, and being unsure of what to GROUPBY, we set this dataset aside for now to analyze the data in the first dataset (public_data.tsv).\n",

    "The attributes (columns) of the dataset are the PID (Project ID), Category (numbers indicating what topic the project falls under), Subcategory (numbers indicating the subtopics within each category), the Project Location Name, State, County, and Country. Other relevant attributes included are the Project Currency, the Project’s Original Goal (how much money the creators were aiming for), amount of money pledged, the number of backers, the launched date, deadline date, and state. State is defined as either suspended (funding for a project is stopped when the project violates Kickstarter’s rules), canceled (the creators of a project dropped the project themselves), failed (the project didn’t meet funding goals), and successful (project meets funding goals). Each observation (row) corresponds to one unique project, indexed with a CaseID.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was created by Jonathan Leland, Kickstarter’s Head of Insights for a cross-sectional study on the different creative projects that seek crowdfunding. He created the dataset to observe data on the projects from Kickstarter. The creation of this dataset is funded by Kickstarter Data, the company crowdfunding platform that directs the Kickstarter Project. The study is distributed through the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some columns may be presented as optional for users to fill out, so we’re left with missing values in the data. For example, for the PROJECT_LOCATION_STATE, PROJECT_LOCATION_COUNTY, PROJECT_LOCATION_COUNTRY column, there are some missing data values. But there are no missing values in the PROJECT_LOCATION_NAME, meaning that the project creators were required to put down the location name for their project. Several restrictions were placed on the data before releasing it for public use. The names of the people/groups who created past Kickstarter projects (NAME) and the links to their projects’ websites (URL_NAME), and the descriptions of their projects (BLURB) are masked in the public data set. This ensures anonymity of survey participants and prevents disclosure risk from survey participants.\n",

    "There are several limitations to our research. Since many variables on our public data tsv are restricted, including the project description, we can’t draw a clear relationship between what exactly about a specific category that leads to it being more or less successful than other categories. This affects the meaning of our results because there are unclear causes that may have a greater impact on how successful a project is. Thus, We can only rely on the Category and Subcategory columns, which only shows numbers corresponding to the category type, but not the names of the categories themselves. So, we don't actually have a clear view on the project content. \n",
    "There may be outside factors such as branding, social media presence, and popularity of the project before it was put on Kickstarter that may affect the success of the project. These confounding variables can skew our results. \n",
    "Furthermore, there are some unclear phrases not explained by the dataset documentation, such as PID and UID. We made the assumption that PID means Project ID, and used it to merge the two datasets. However, if it means something else, then it could negatively affect our data and our conclusions. \n"
